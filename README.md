============

I love webOS. However, the fact is that, right now, one can do more with Android than with webOS. I run CM9 on my Touchpad and the quirks of my Pre 2 are irritating. I'm switching to a Galaxy Nexus and need to convert data for some apps.

byebye-webOS is a collection of scripts to convert data from webOS application to Android alternatives. Feel free to reuse these script if you're switching phone/tablet to Android. Be aware that you will, most certainly, have to modify them to suit your needs. Fork away!
